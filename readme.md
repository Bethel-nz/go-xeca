# GoXeca

original inspiration was gotten from [Albrow Jobs](https://github.com/albrow/jobs)
i was able to get it up and running,
you can send job requests to the server via the /api/add-job endpoint, and get the status of the job via the /api/status endpoint
only problem is it takes way more longer to execute the jobs than it should

- [ ] fix the jobs execution time
- [ ] handle job chaining and more concurrently
- [ ] build a simple react frontend to interact with the system

## use case

you can use this package to run cron jobs, and send status updates to the server,
if you need to run or test certain commands at specific intervals, this might be what you need
